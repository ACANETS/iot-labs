Lab exercises for Internet-of-Things course

Welcome to iot-labs !

You can find here a series of hands-on exercies for learning IoT device design and software development. We try to cover the principles of hardware operation and design methodologies through mini-projects centered around Raspberry Pi Zero W, a very low-cost and versatile development board. You will be introduced to topics such as sensors, interfacing, audio signal processing, computer vision and cloud computing. Through the labs and with your creativity, you can build many different interesting IoT devices, for example, an IoT device that can synchronize a LED light with the beats of a song track, and an IoT device that can detect a cat face and ring a bell ;-)
