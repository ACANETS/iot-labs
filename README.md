Lab exercises for Internet-of-Things course

Welcome to iot-labs !

You can find here a series of hands-on exercises for learning IoT device design and software development. We try to cover the principles of hardware operation and design methodologies through mini-projects centered around Raspberry Pi Zero W, a very low-cost and versatile development board. You will be introduced to topics such as sensors, interfacing, audio signal processing, computer vision and cloud computing. Through the labs and with your creativity, you can build a few interesting IoT devices, for example, an IoT device that can synchronize a LED light with the beats of a song track, or an IoT device that can recognize a cat face and ring a bell ;-)   

The following topics are covered in labs:
1. Lab 1 "Hello IoT" :- Embedded system architecture, development environment, sample applications, GPIO.
2. Lab 2 "I am HoT" :- Sensors, interfaces, bus protocols, programming I<sup>2</sup>C devices.
3. Lab 3 "Shine the Lights" :- Pulse Width Modulation, programming smart LEDs.
4. Lab 4 "Dance with the Music" :- audio signal processing, I<sup>2</sup>S bus, programming I<sup>2</sup>S microphone and processing sound.
5. Lab 5 "Let's Talk" :- Embedded OS, bootloader, network programming.
6. Lab 6 "Say Cheese" :- camera sensor, OpenCV programming.
7. Lab 7 "Over the Rainbow" :- cloud programming and building a cloud service.
