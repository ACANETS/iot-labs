Lab 1 "Hello IoT"

There are millions of IoT devices out there and each has its own functionalities and purposes. Under the hood, they are essentially an embedded devices with some types of sensors and a microprocessor to process the sensor data. We use [Raspberriy Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) as our experimental platform because it is equipped with versatile interfaces and adequate processing capability. What is more, itself costs only USD $10!     

The following topics are covered in this lab:
1. Lab 1 "Hello IoT" :- Embedded system architecture, development environment, sample applications, GPIO.
2. Lab 2 "I am HoT" :- Sensors, interfaces, bus protocols, programming I<sup>2</sup>C devices.
3. Lab 3 "Shine the Lights" :- Pulse Width Modulation, programming smart LEDs.
4. Lab 4 "Dance with the Music" :- audio signal processing, I<sup>2</sup>S bus, programming I<sup>2</sup>S microphone and processing sound.
5. Lab 5 "Let's Talk" :- Embedded OS, bootloader, network programming.
6. Lab 6 "Say Cheese" :- camera sensor, OpenCV programming.
7. Lab 7 "Over the Rainbow" :- cloud programming and building a cloud service.

#Prerequisites

Please familiarize yourself with the following concepts before proceed with this lab:
* Linux. We will use Linux throughout this and other labs. It is different from a Windows environment, but you will soon find it liberate us to perform simple and direct control on devices. You need to know basic Linux commands such as ```ls''' and ```pwd'''.
* Python. We primarily use Python as our programming language in these labs. You can of course adapt the examples from Python to other languages, but your mileage varies. So pick up a quick tutorial such as [this one](https://www.learnpython.org) if you are new to it.
* You need to have a laptop with at least one USB2.0 or USB3.0 port to run the labs. Windows, Mac, Linux laptops should all work, but we have not tested on USB-C ports.
